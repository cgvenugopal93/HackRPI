SafePass, modern day safety passport necessary for all of us. COVID-19 has dramatically changed the way we go about our daily lives, especially visiting public places. The challenges we faced right from university closures to buying groceries has motivated us to create this "passport".

SafePass leverages NLP tools to identify COVID-19 positive persons in real-time and geolocation capabilities to tag the locations visited by them, inturn warning other persons who might have crossed their paths in real time. This will enable small businesses and the general public, a safe informed access to public places, a vital necessity in these times.

The app offers the option for users to sign up. Once the user signs up and logs in, a general view for any user will contain their passport, news feed and the maps.
Passport - Green, yellow and red
News feed - real time updates
Map - potential covid exposed places in the vicinity based on others' COVID reporting.
